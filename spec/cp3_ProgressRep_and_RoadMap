Checkpoint 3 Report:
	Our pipeline has full forwarding, and has stall logic implemented to avoid hazards. We have
a paramaterized 2 way cache implemented and linked to the cache hierarchy and CPU. We also have
a working paramaterized 4 way pseudo LRU cache implemented that can be hooked up to our system 
at any time. Our Clock rate remains around 108 MHz as we did not get the time to optimize our
longest data path but we have plans to pipline and simplify the arbiter. We didn't have time to 
design alot of our advanced features nor Branch Prediction but have begun brainstorming.

Checkpoint 3 Roadmap:
	-Branch Prediction, which includes alot of our advanced design features
		4-Way BTB
		Local Branch Table
	-Victim Cache
	-Optimizations for Clock Rate
