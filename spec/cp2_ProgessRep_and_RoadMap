Checkpoint 2 Report:
    Our pipline build can now handle all instructions, has  stall logic for
memory functions, has the 2 L1 caches implemented and a cache arbiter linked
up to physical memory. We clock in at around 108 MHz but are looking to
optimize. We have the design for are forwarding logic and have documented the
actual logic in a document on our project google drive. We also have all the
stall logic in a file on the google drive also. We have also designed and builtan
expanded 2-way L2 cache that we are currently testing. We have also trimmed
our git branches to a more manageable size.

Checkpoint 2 Roadmap:
    -Full integration of 4-way L2 Cache
    -Forwarding fully implemented
    -Clock Rate optimization
    -Hazard Protection
    -Design(Implementation?) Branch Prediction
    -Designs for advance features
