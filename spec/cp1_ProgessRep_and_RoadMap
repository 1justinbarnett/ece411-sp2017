Checkpoint 1 Progress Report:
    Our initial pipeline build can now handle ADD, AND, NOT, LDR, STR and BR
instructions. We have initial designs of the pieces of our cache hierarchy but
we have many adjustments in mind. These adjustments include, setting up the
I-cache to be Read-Only and expanding the L2 Cache. We have also begun to plan
about how to adjust the datapath to account for the non perfect memory, hazards
and the remaining instructions. We are clocking around 157 MHz so speed is not
really an issue as of now. Any information in relation to contents of the pipe-
line registers or signal definitions is well defined in a project Google Drive.

Checkpoint 1 Road Map:
    We originally anticipated only doing the bear minimum for caches but looking
at the schedules we have decided we are going to take a more aggressive time-
line for the cache development as alot of our advanced design points come from
the cache and we won't want to do things regressively. Below is a general over-
view of our plan for the next checkpoint:

    -2-way set associative L1 I-Cache and L1 D-Cache
    -4-way 2-cycle set associative L2 Cache (with pseudo LRU)
    -Cache Arbiter
    -Proper Integration into Datapath
    -Design for Hazard Protection and Forwarding
    -Clean up Git repository (trimming branches and such)
    -Clean up code base (removing any unnecessary module files)
